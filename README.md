# MD5-Hash-Decryption-Program-
A program that decrypts md5 hashes of 4 digit to 8 digit PIN numbers (integers) by comparing the hash with encoded formats of wordlist contents. 
This is not an ideal program for cracking most passwords, but this is just to demostrate the process of password hash decryption.
I hope you will find this code to be useful :)
