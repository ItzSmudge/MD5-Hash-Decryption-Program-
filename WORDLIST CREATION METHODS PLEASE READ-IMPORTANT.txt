In order to create a wordlist, I used crunch in Linux. I used Kali linux for this. This process will be the same for all Debian and Ubuntu based distros.

Crunch can be installed with the following command in ubuntu and debian based distros:
sudo apt install crunch

For other distros such as Fedora etc, the .tgz file can be downloaded from this link: 
https://sourceforge.net/projects/crunch-wordlist/files/latest/download

The wordlist can be created with the following command:

crunch 4 8 0123456789 -o file path/nameoffile.txt

For example in my case it was:

crunch 4 8 0123456789 -o /home/username/Documents/PIN.txt

(I have uploaded images for ease)

Explanation:
crunch 4 8 0123456789 -o /home/username/Documents/PIN.txt
  |    | |     |            
  |    | |   range of characters
  |    | | 
  |    | maximum number of characters in a password
  |   minimum number of characters in a password
  |
command call

REMEMBER : crunch is just one way of creating a wordlist. Online utilities such as at 
https://www.wordlist-generator.net/ 
This can be used for non-linux users.

However, crunch is a more convenient way of making one.
I apologise for being unable to upload the wordlist for file size restrictions.
